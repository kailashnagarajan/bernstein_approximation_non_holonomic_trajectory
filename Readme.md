# Bernstein's approximation of non holonomic motion equation

Non-holonomic equation = ` ydot(t) = xdot(t) tan(theta(t)) `

## The approximation involves the following steps 

- Approximate x(t) and tan(theta(t)) with beizer curves

- Differentiate the Bernstein's approximation 

- Find the weights of the bernstein polynomial for constraints

- Get the y(t) and x(t)


## The code doesn't require mathematica and order can be varied

## Bernstein's approximation is uniform even over higher derivatives
